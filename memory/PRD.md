## Changelog

### March 31, 2026 - Code Quality & Deployment Fix
**Critical Fixes:**
1. ✅ Added `/health` endpoint to `server.py` - ROOT CAUSE of deployment failures
2. ✅ Removed hardcoded secrets from 6 test files, centralized in `conftest.py`
3. ✅ Created `secureStorage.js` with AES-GCM encryption for localStorage
4. ✅ Fixed 3 bare `except` clauses in backend services
5. ✅ Fixed React array index keys in FailureModesPage and MyTasksPage

**Previous Session Fixes (March 30-31):**

## Architecture Notes

### Key Files
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Main FastAPI entry point with /health endpoint
- `/app/backend/tests/conftest.py` - Centralized test configuration
- `/app/frontend/src/services/secureStorage.js` - Encrypted localStorage wrapper

### Security Considerations
- Test credentials loaded from environment variables
- localStorage data encrypted with AES-GCM via Web Crypto API
- Session-scoped encryption keys stored in sessionStorage

### Deployment Requirements
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health` returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
- Backend runs on port 8001
- Frontend runs on port 3000
- MongoDB connection via MONGO_URL environment variable
